The goal of this project layout is to provide a very low barrier to entry for 
starting new modules, a very simple module structure, and easy expansion.

A compromise we make is that we allow lots of parallel directories and 
repositories. 


To ease work, we provide some scripts to help out.


Directories:

./CMakeModules      #Houses FindXXXX.cmake files for our project
./Build_Tools       #Scripts for building sources





Normally you will be using the libraries of others as installed 
binaries.


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade


Development Workflow
====================

drc help    # Print help info
drc reset   # Deletes all prj/build directories to create a known state
drc fetch   # Fetch on all the git repos

drc build <directories>     # Adds a build folder to each directory and builds each based on their debian dependencies


1. checkout or create a new repository
2. mkdir build;cd build;cmake .. on each new repository
3. Code, make, test
