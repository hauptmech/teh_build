# Simple template to find local includes and libraries before system ones.
#
# The variables TEH_LIBRARY_NAME and TEH_INCLUDE_PATH_INDICATOR_FILE are used
# this projects CMakeLists.txt generates xxxConfig.cmake  
#
  # Required
# TEH_LIBRARY_NAME - The name of this library package
# TEH_EXPORTED_LIBRARIES - Individual names of library files
# TEH_INCLUDE_PATH_INDICATOR_FILE - Marker file for include directory

	# For dependencies
# TEH_DEPENDENCY_LIBRARIES - Libraries we depend on

	# For extra search power
# TEH_INC_SUFFIX - Location of include dir relative to lib dir
