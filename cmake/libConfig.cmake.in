# Simple template to find local includes and libraries before system ones.
#
# The variables LIBRARY_NAME and INCLUDE_PATH_INDICATOR_FILE are used
# this projects CMakeLists.txt generates xxxConfig.cmake  
#
# The variables LOCAL_FIND_PATHS and LOCAL_FIND_LIBRARY_PATHS are set
# by the calling CMakeLists.txt to where we expect to find the include
# directory indicator file. They will be set by the CMakeLists.txt 
# of the project trying to use this file via find_package(xxx)



### find and set xxx_LIBRARIES ###


# Search local paths first
